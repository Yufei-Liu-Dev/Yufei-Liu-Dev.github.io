Hi, I am a second-year master's student currently pursuing my degree at the National University of Defense Technology(NUDT), advised by  <a href="https://chen-xieyuanli.github.io" target="_blank">Associate Professor Xieyuanli Chen</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cp-6u7wAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank">Professor Huimin Lu</a>. My research centers on 3D perception, 3D reconstruction, embodied intelligence and spatial understanding. Before that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Automation Engineering at NUDT.
